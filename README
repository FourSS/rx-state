RxState
=========================

The library uses the similar to Redux, but it uses Rx to achieve top down
unidirectional data flow

## Installation

RxState requires **React 0.15 or later.** and **Rxjs 5.0**

```
npm install --save rx-state
```

Works with react-native out of the box


The library is inspired by http://michalzalecki.com/use-rxjs-with-react/.
However I have added Provider component and ActionFactory
